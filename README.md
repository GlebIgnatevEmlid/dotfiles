Prerequisites
========

- Install Zsh
- Install [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
- Install [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font for [spaceship-prompt](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt) theme
- [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) needs you to have `python` in your system, thus you could install `python` or create an alias for your `python3`
(It's relevant for Ubuntu 18.04+ as python 2.7 is not preinstalled there)
